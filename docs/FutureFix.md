# Improvements and Fixes for Transaction Management

## 1. Fix Transaction Display
### Problem
The current implementation incorrectly displays the roles of users in transactions (i.e., who is the sender and who is the recipient).

### Solution
- Update the transaction model to clearly define the sender and recipient roles.
- Modify the transaction display logic in the api to ensure that the sender and recipient are correctly identified.

### Implementation Steps
- Update the `Transaction` model if necessary.
- Adjust the views to fetch and display the correct user roles. 
- Writing more comprehensive unit tests to check that transactions are displayed correctly.

## 2. Add Pagination to Transaction History
### Problem
The transaction history is currently displayed without pagination, making it difficult to navigate through large datasets.

### Solution
- Implement pagination in the transaction history view.

### Implementation Steps
- Use Django's built-in pagination classes (`Paginator`, `Page`).
- Update the view to paginate the transaction list.
- Modify the template to include pagination controls (e.g., "Next", "Previous", page numbers).

## 3. Improve Transaction Security
### Problem
The current transaction process may have security vulnerabilities.

### Solution
- Implement additional security measures to protect against common vulnerabilities (e.g., CSRF, XSS).
- Ensure that all sensitive actions are properly authenticated and authorized.

### Implementation Steps
- Use Django's built-in security features (e.g., CSRF protection).
- Validate user permissions before allowing transactions.
- Consider implementing rate limiting to prevent abuse.

## 4. Implement Caching
### Problem
The application may experience performance issues due to frequent database queries for transaction data.

### Solution
- Implement caching to reduce database load and improve response times.

### Implementation Steps
- Use Django's caching framework to cache transaction data.
- Determine appropriate cache keys and expiration times.
- Test the caching implementation to ensure data consistency.

## 5. Improve Admin Panel
### Problem
The current admin panel may not provide a user-friendly experience for managing transactions.

### Solution
- Enhance the Django admin interface for better interaction with transaction data.

### Implementation Steps
- Customize the admin panel to display relevant transaction fields.
- Add filters and search functionality to the transaction list.
- Implement inline editing for quick updates to transaction records.

## Conclusion
By addressing these areas, we can significantly improve the transaction management system in our Django application, enhancing both user experience and security.
